# Burger

Eat-The-Burger is a fun app that allows the users to enter the name of a burger they want to eat.

Once submited, the burger is displayed in text on the left side of the page where it's waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. Once clicked, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

Every burger entered is stored in the MySQL database.
